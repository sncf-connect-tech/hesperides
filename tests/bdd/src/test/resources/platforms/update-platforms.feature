  Scenario: restoring properties of a deployed module to a previous version
    Given a module with a property "version" existing in versions: 1, 2, 3
    And an existing platform with this module in version 1 and the property "version" valued accordingly
    And I update the module version on this platform successively to versions 2, 3 updating the value of the "version" property accordingly
    When I update the module version on this platform to version 1
    Then property "version" has for value "1" on the platform

  #issue-564
  Scenario: restoring properties of a deployed module to a previous version but hitting the history limit
    Given a module with a property "version" existing in versions: 1, 2, 3, 4
    And an existing platform with this module in version 1 and the property "version" valued accordingly
    And I update the module version on this platform successively to versions 2, 3, 4 updating the value of the "version" property accordingly
