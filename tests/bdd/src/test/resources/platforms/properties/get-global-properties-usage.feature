Feature: Get global properties usage

  Background:
    Given an authenticated user

  Scenario: get global properties used in a platform module and techno template
    Given an existing techno with global properties
    And an existing module with global properties and this techno
    And an existing platform with this module and global properties
    When I get this platform global properties usage
    Then the platform global properties usage is successfully retrieved

  Scenario: get global properties used as deployed module property value
    Given an existing techno with properties
    And an existing module with properties and this techno
    And an existing platform with this module and global properties
    And the deployed module has properties with values referencing global properties
    When I get this platform global properties usage
    Then the platform global properties usage is successfully retrieved

  Scenario: get global properties used as deployed module property value and removed from the module afterwards
    Given an existing techno with properties
    And an existing module with properties and this techno
    And an existing platform with this module and global properties
    And the deployed module has properties with values referencing global properties
    And the properties are removed from the module
    When I get this platform global properties usage
    Then the platform global properties usage is successfully retrieved

  Scenario: get global properties used in iterable properties
    Given an existing module with iterable properties referencing global properties
    And an existing platform with this module and global properties
    When I get this platform global properties usage
    Then the platform global properties usage is successfully retrieved

  Scenario: get global properties used in iterable properties values
    Given an existing module with iterable properties
    And an existing platform with this module and global properties
    And the deployed module has iterable properties with values referencing the global properties
    When I get this platform global properties usage
    Then the platform global properties usage is successfully retrieved
